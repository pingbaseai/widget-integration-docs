1. During the last step of organization onboarding, you will receive your unique "ORG_TOKEN" for your organization.
2. Copy the script tag below and paste it at the top of the `<head></head>` tag in your web app HTML

```html index.html
<script id="ping-base-script" type="text/javascript" src="https://pingbasecdn.blob.core.windows.net/pb-connect/prod/main.js" defer></script>
```

3. Integrate PingBase into your web app

Installing pingbase connect using NPM or Yarn

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash NPM
npm install @pingbase/connect
```

    ```bash Yarn
yarn install @pingbase/connect
```
</CodeGroup>

## Importing and using PingBase widget in your web app

Once you have installed the package using NPM or Yarn, you can import PingBase using the code below

```typescript
import PingBase from '@pingbase/connect/PingBase';
```

#### Sample Usage:

```typescript
import PingBase from '@pingbase/connect/PingBase';

// Assuming that onMount is called on first render
const onMount = () => {
    PingBase("initOrg", <ORG_TOKEN>, {
        autoConnect: false
    })
}

// Assuming that onLogin is called once user login to your webapp
const onLogin = () => {
    PingBase("initUser", "name@company.com", "Roger", "Federer", "Free Trial", {
        role: "User Role",
        company: "User Company",
        isNewUser: true,
    })
}

// Assuming that onShow is called once user login to your webapp and onLogin is called.
const onShow = () => {
    PingBase("connect")
}

// Assuming that onHide is called whenever you want to disconnect the user. Ex: onLogout
const onHide = () => {
    PingBase("disconnect")
}
```
