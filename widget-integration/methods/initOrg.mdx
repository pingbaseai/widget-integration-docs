### `initOrg`: PingBase("initOrg", orgKey, options?)

This method should be called only once when any user comes to the platform to initialize the organization with PingBase.

```typescript
// NOTE: This is an optional parameter.
const options = {
    /**
    * This is used to specify whether to connect the user
    * directly when the initUser command is called. If set to false,
    * you need to connect the user explicitly using PingBase("connect")
    *
    * Defaults to true.
    */
    autoConnect?: boolean
}
```

```typescript {3}
import PingBase from '@pingbase/connect/PingBase';

PingBase("initOrg", "ORG_TOKEN", options)
```

Initializes the organization for connection. Params:

* `orgKey: string`: A unique token given at the time of organization onboarding.
* `options: object` (Optional): Additional options to customize.
  * `autoConnect: boolean = true` (Optional): Specifies whether to connect the user directly when the `initUser` command is called. If set to false, you need to connect the user explicitly using `PingBase("connect")`.
